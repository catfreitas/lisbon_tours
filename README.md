# "Lisbon Tours"

I'm training my front-end skills and in this project I use Swiper and Scroll Reveal to improve the user experience.
This project is a layout of a web application for presenting tours in Lisbon (the content used is random)

See how it looks! https://catfreitas.github.io/lisbon_tours/
